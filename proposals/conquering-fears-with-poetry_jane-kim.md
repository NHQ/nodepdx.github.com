Conquering Fears with Poetry (and Javascript)
========================

* Speaker   : Jane Kim
* Available : June 20-21 all day
* Length    : 25 min

Description
-----------

Lots of things in life are scary. For me, code is one of them, but sometimes you have to push yourself into the deep end by pursuing something you care about and combining it with code in a personal project. The final product is [Exquisite Texts](exquisitetexts.com), which enables strangers to write dope poetry with each other. But first I will talk about my journey in realizing that I am a programmer, how I came across poetry, and struggling with side project / life balance. We'll have a little audience participation and poems get written real-time while the talk is happening
